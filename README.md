# Weather App

A Flutter weather app built with Riverpod and [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

## Installation

To get started with the Weather App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akhlashashmi/weather.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd weather
    ```

3. **Install all necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Run the Flutter project:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather information for any location.
- **5-Day Forecast:** View weather forecasts for the next five days.
- **City Search:** Search for weather information in any city.
- **Dark Mode:** Supports dark mode for better usability in low-light environments.

## How It's Built

1. **API Analysis:** Analyzed the behavior of APIs provided by WeatherAPI to understand the data structure and endpoints.
2. **Data Repository:** Created a repository for fetching data from the API, ensuring separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
3. **State Management:** Used Riverpod to manage state effectively throughout the app, enabling a reactive and maintainable codebase.
4. **User Interface:** Designed and built a user-friendly UI, focusing on usability and visual appeal.

Due to time constraints, the initial focus was on implementing core functionality, with UI design being finalized later.
